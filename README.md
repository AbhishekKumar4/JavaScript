# Dynamic Typing
# Primitive Types (no methods, immutable)
    - undefined
    - null
    - boolean
    - number (-ve, +ve, floats, numbers)
    - string
    - (symbol) special in ES6

# Typecasting? Coercion(Changing one type to another)
    - const x = 42;
    - const explicit = String(x); // explicit === 42
    - const implicit = x + "";    // implicit === 42
    
- == vs. ===
    - == coerces the types
    - === requires equivalent types.
